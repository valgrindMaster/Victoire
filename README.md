<h1>Incomplete App Alert</h1>
<h2>Last Spring, this app was being developed for a local restaurant, until they unfortunately went out of business.</h2>
<hr>
<p> This app will not run. It requires authentication with an "Untappd" API that is no longer active. Furthermore, the app has not been run or further developed since the time of closing, thus it is surely out of date in terms of libraries, design of implementation, etc. This remains here as a small but hopefully useful sample of my hands-on "real-world" experience with Android development.</p>
<p><em>This app was being developed with Xamarin.</p>
